      "I'll make you travel the world" was the sequence of words that you could often hear coming out from my mouth to my parents when I was a kid. <br/> 
<br/>
I'm sure that they were received in the same way as when a kid says "I want to be an astronaut or a president". They didn't completely disregard it because everything is possible but they knew it's highly unlikely, yet still nod the head and go along with it to keep me excited.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, it was absolutely certain. <br/>
There were many things I would say that even I knew isn't possible. But this one was not one of them. <br/>
I didn't know when but I knew I will. Sooner the better. <br/>
<br/>
And soon it was. <br/>
I finally started the delivery of my childish promise on 13th March 2019.
It started with Rome and Venice. <br/>
<br/>
I do not, yet, have the skills to describe the beauty of these cities. I can just say that they were magically beautiful. Imagine the most beautiful place you've been to and the narrow streets from Piazza di Trevi in Rome are twice as beautiful. <br/>
Pizzerias in every corner serving better pizza than the last one. it is not possible to roam around the city with an empty stomach. 
5€ wine bottle from a supermarket might be the best wine you've ever tasted.<br/>
On the other hand, Venice has its own charm. You would hear that it's the most unique city in the world and you even might agree with it but you would not actually understand the meaning of that unless you visit Venice. <br/>
Not much to do other than aimlessly wandering in streets and crossing small bridges over narrow canals hoping to find the grand canal to orient yourself. But you wouldn't even want to do anything else. <br/>
<br/>
Now, framed as a gift to parents, it was also a great opportunity for me. Not only these cities are beautiful but they also hold thousands of years of history. and I love the places that have historic importance.<br/>
<br/>
Traveling there with parents also had one more upside. I was borderline obsessed with providing them with an enjoyable and knowledgeable experience. Making them walk through Vatican museums and climbing floors of Colosseum cluelessly wouldn't accomplish that. <br/>
So, I had to dig considerably deep inside the history of the places we were going to visit. Spending hours watching documentaries and reading about Colosseum, History of Vatican city, and the importance of Venice gave me extra joy or further intrigued me when I visited those places.
I intend to do this kind of homework before going on my future trips.
<br/><br/>

I would recommend people to consider giving trips as a gift to their parents. Experiences and memories are long preserved and most joyful. isn't that what you want in your gift?<br/>
It is expensive, but the significance of the experiences can't be measured on the paper notes.<br/>
It was a magnificent experience for my folks and in return, it gave me very much pleasure. <br/>
Of course, I learned what I have to do differently for their future trips. Direct flights to the destination and hotels close to the city center is a must among other small things. <br/>
I might not be with them on their future trips but even sitting at home while they enjoy some part of this beautiful world would give me great satisfaction. <br/>
<br/>
I will remember my promise as a kid and keep them traveling the world.<br/>
