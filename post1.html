      21-year-old Indian in Finland, studying in TUT (now TAU) and working for Kii/Ainak Oy as a Project manager. <br/><br/>

Embarking on the journey to master the skill of writing by starting a blog.<br/>
I will be writing about topics ranging from software programming to cooking to notes by exalted guest lectures to Culture in Finland.<br/><br/>

I am hoping to make 2019 a learning year. I am a big fan of learning skills and I (try to) do so regularly. But reflecting back, 2018 was a bit short on the expectation. It was still an excellent year, with a great many events and travels (My best year so far) but if I examine what new skills I learned, then the list doesn’t start growing.<br/><br/>

In 2019, I plan to develop myself in both, soft skills, and hard skills.<br/>
Soft skills include better writing(this blog), better communication with people, team management techniques (by implementing them in my work) and better time management.<br/>
Hard skills encompass learning Web development (full stack) and graphic design.<br/><br/>

Getting yourself to write every day is quite difficult and impractical, to be honest. That’s why I’ve decided to write every Wednesday one article and edit (format or whatever you call it) during Thursday.<br/>
About other skills that I’m planning to learn, I haven’t made any specific plan for them yet. At least not for other soft skills but for Hard skills, I’ve started a project (I'll write more about it later) because learning by doing is by far the most effective way for me.<br/>
 Once I’m good with Web development skills (which will take some time, especially front end), then I’ll move to Graphic design. I might even take some proper courses in summer, to actually get into the artistic zone for graphic design.<br/><br/>

Yeah Yeah, I know this is somewhat typical “New year resolution or new year new me” stuff but I think it’s beneficial in long term.<br/>
Bad image for these “This year is going to be my learning year” is because people can’t keep up the promise they made to themselves.<br/>
Now I have a healthy pressure to keep up, otherwise, I’ll be just one of those people (And I’d hate that very much).<br/><br/>

So in the end, It can go either of two way. Either I'll get lazy and forget about the whole thing and go back to my normal schedule, then so be it. Or I'll stick to my commitment and actually get better at stuff that I only fancy about getting good at (especially when browsing through Dribbble and thinking how are these people so creative?!?).<br/><br/>
