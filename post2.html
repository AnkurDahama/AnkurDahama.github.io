      The measure of a man is his state of mind...
    </H2><br/>
    <p>

      It requires 10000 hours to master a skill. <br/>
However truthful the number might be, but general idea valid. It takes practice, experience, and repetitions to develop a skill. 
Beethoven didn't compose the fifth symphony the first time he put his hands on a piano. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The world has moved to service-based industries where most of the value provided by a company is due to its employees rather than the product itself. <br/>
Some would argue that the success of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other giants is because they hire the best of best.<br/>
<br/>
Some more Non-Billion-dollar Finnish companies come to my mind when thinking about this topic. <br/>
Gofore and Vincit, these two are well-known software companies in Finland and both of them focus on making their brand "Cool place to work".<br/>
It is an interesting phenomenon because this brand image wouldn't directly give them an advantage in actually selling their services or products but it indirectly conveys the message that "We have most talented people working with us, so you can guess how good products we have".<br/>
<br/>
Having the best talent working for you is only possible if you can filter them out from a huge pile of candidates.<br/>
<br/>
This problem becomes increasingly difficult when we start to move from hard skills to soft skills. <br/>
If you're a hospital looking for best surgeons, you will probably filter the candidates out from how many successful surgeries they have performed and what university they got their doctorate from. <br/>
<br/>
Now let's say you're hiring a UX Designer, it gets a bit trickier because you can't just rely on their degree at all. Previous projects become the main driver but quantifying them isn't as easy as counting the number of successful bypass surgeries. <br/>
<br/>
What about self-taught designers who aren't top notch now but their rate of learning or improvement is amazing?  missing out on this talent would hurt, won't it?<br/>
<br/>
And when you're hiring a primary school teacher, things suddenly become even worse because there is no driver that can convey the level of skills in handling kids and teaching them basics of probably everything that they'll learn in their life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The grass is not so much greener on the other side. <br/>
As difficult as it is for recruiters to filter out good talent, it's also very difficult for people to demonstrate their skills. <br/>
I think the main reason for it is that "Selling yourself" or using more appropriate terms "Demonstrating your skills" is also a skill. A very important one indeed.<br/>
<br/>
This skill of demonstrating your skills bring little value to most of the workplaces. I agree that it might be useful in some areas like sales and upper-level leadership but for a large spectrum, it brings little value. <br/>
<br/>
So the importance of it is little and it is the highest impacting skills in the decision whether you'll work at your dream place. <br/>
<br/>
This situation requires some solution that can address the problems and I will discuss it in another post. <br/>
<br/>
Till then, <br/>
